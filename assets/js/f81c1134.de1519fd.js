PostHog is an open-source analytics platform that combines **product analytics**, **web analytics**, **session recordings**, and **feature flags** in a single tool. Here\'s a practical guide to getting the most out of it.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Why PostHog?\\n\\nMost teams start analytics with one question: *\\"Are users actually using what we built?\\"* PostHog helps you answer that \u2014 and much more:\\n\\n- Which features do users actually use?\\n- Where do users drop off in key workflows?\\n- How do different user segments interact with the product?\\n- What is the conversion rate for critical actions?\\n- Where is our web traffic coming from?\\n\\nWithout analytics, you\'re guessing. PostHog gives you the data to answer these questions from a single platform, without stitching together multiple tools.\\n\\n![posthog.png](./images/posthog-dashboard-view.png)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Part 1: Product Analytics\\n\\n### Identifying and Tracking Key Events\\n\\nThe foundation of PostHog is **event tracking**. An event is any meaningful user action \u2014 clicking a button, submitting a form, visiting a page. You define what matters for your product.\\n\\nGood events to track:\\n- Feature accessed (user opens a key module)\\n- Workflow started (user begins a multi-step process)\\n- Workflow completed (user finishes the process)\\n- Business action taken (user creates/sends/updates something)\\n\\n**Tip:** Use a consistent naming convention like `feature_accessed`, `form_submitted`, `workflow_completed`. This makes querying and building dashboards much easier.\\n\\n### User Identification and Segmentation\\n\\nWhen users log in, identify them in PostHog so you can segment analytics by user properties:\\n\\n```js\\nposthog.identify(userId, {\\n  email: user.email,\\n  role: user.role,       // e.g. admin, editor, viewer\\n  plan: user.plan,       // e.g. free, pro, enterprise\\n});\\n```\\n\\nThis lets you answer questions like:\\n- Do Pro users use Feature X more than Free users?\\n- Do Admin users complete the onboarding workflow at a higher rate?\\n\\nAvoid storing sensitive PII beyond what\'s needed for segmentation. User ID, role, and plan tier are usually sufficient.\\n\\n### Feature Adoption Tracking\\n\\nTrack when users access your major features to understand what\'s being used:\\n\\n```js\\nposthog.capture(\'feature_accessed\', {\\n  feature: \'reporting_dashboard\',\\n  source: \'sidebar_nav\',\\n});\\n```\\n\\nOver time this reveals:\\n- Which features drive the most engagement\\n- Which features are underutilised despite investment\\n- Which features are \\"sticky\\" (users return to them regularly)\\n\\n### Funnel Analysis: Finding Drop-Off Points\\n\\nFunnel analysis is one of PostHog\'s most powerful capabilities. For any multi-step workflow, you can build a funnel to see where users drop off.\\n\\n**Example: A 5-step onboarding funnel**\\n\\n| Step | Event | Conversion |\\n|---|---|---|\\n| 1 | `signup_completed` | 100% |\\n| 2 | `onboarding_started` | 82% |\\n| 3 | `profile_setup_done` | 61% |\\n| 4 | `first_feature_used` | 44% |\\n| 5 | `onboarding_completed` | 31% |\\n\\nFrom this you can immediately see that the biggest drop-off is between steps 3 and 4. That\'s where to focus improvement efforts.\\n\\nIn PostHog, you build funnels by selecting the ordered sequence of events and filtering by date range, user properties, or cohorts.\\n\\n### Cohort Analysis\\n\\nGroup users into **cohorts** based on shared properties or behaviours and compare how they use your product:\\n\\n- Users who signed up in January vs February\\n- Power users (more than 10 sessions/week) vs casual users\\n- Mobile users vs desktop users\\n\\nCohort comparison helps you understand which user segments are most successful and what drives retention.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Part 2: Web Analytics\\n\\nPostHog\'s **Web Analytics** dashboard gives you a Google Analytics-style view of your website traffic without the privacy concerns and without needing a separate tool.\\n\\n### Traffic Overview\\n\\nThe web analytics dashboard shows at a glance:\\n\\n- **Unique visitors** \u2014 how many individual users visited\\n- **Pageviews** \u2014 total pages viewed\\n- **Sessions** \u2014 grouped visits per user\\n- **Bounce rate** \u2014 percentage of single-page sessions\\n- **Session duration** \u2014 average time users spend on the site\\n\\nThese metrics are available by day, week, or month, with trend comparisons to previous periods.\\n\\n### Traffic Sources\\n\\nUnderstanding where your users come from helps you prioritise marketing and content efforts. PostHog breaks down traffic by:\\n\\n| Source | What it tells you |\\n|---|---|\\n| **Direct** | Users who typed your URL or came from bookmarks |\\n| **Organic search** | Users from Google/Bing \u2014 a signal of SEO health |\\n| **Referral** | Users from links on other websites |\\n| **Social** | Traffic from Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. |\\n| **Email** | Traffic from email campaigns (via UTM params) |\\n| **Paid** | Traffic from ads (via UTM params) |\\n\\n**UTM tracking tip:** Always append UTM parameters to links you share in campaigns:\\n```\\nhttps://yoursite.com/blog?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=feb-2026\\n```\\nPostHog automatically captures these and attributes sessions correctly.\\n\\n### Top Pages and Entry/Exit Analysis\\n\\nPostHog shows you:\\n- **Most visited pages** \u2014 where users spend the most time\\n- **Top entry pages** \u2014 where users first land on your site\\n- **Top exit pages** \u2014 where users leave \u2014 potential friction points\\n\\nIf a key product page has a high exit rate, that\'s a signal to investigate with session recordings.\\n\\n### Geographic and Device Breakdown\\n\\nUnderstand your audience better with:\\n- **Countries and cities** \u2014 where your users are located\\n- **Browsers** \u2014 Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge breakdown\\n- **Device type** \u2014 desktop vs mobile vs tablet\\n- **OS** \u2014 Windows, macOS, iOS, Android\\n\\nThis helps with decisions like: *\\"Should we invest more in mobile optimisation?\\"* or *\\"Are we supporting the right browsers?\\"*\\n\\n### Web Vitals (Core Web Vitals)\\n\\nPostHog can track **Google\'s Core Web Vitals** directly:\\n\\n| Metric | What it measures | Good threshold |\\n|---|---|---|\\n| **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint) | Load performance | &lt; 2.5s |\\n| **FID** / **INP** (Interaction to Next Paint) | Interactivity | &lt; 200ms |\\n| **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift) | Visual stability | &lt; 0.1 |\\n\\nPoor Core Web Vitals hurt both user experience and search rankings. Tracking these in PostHog alongside user behaviour data means you can directly correlate slow pages with higher bounce rates.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Part 3: Session Recordings\\n\\nSession recordings let you **watch how real users navigate your product** \u2014 clicks, scrolls, form interactions, and navigation paths \u2014 without seeing any sensitive input data (PostHog masks form fields by default).\\n\\n### When to Use Session Recordings\\n\\n- **After a spike in bounce rate** \u2014 watch what users do before leaving\\n- **When funnel drop-off increases** \u2014 see what happens at the step where users quit\\n- **After launching a new UI** \u2014 validate that users understand and use it as intended\\n- **When support tickets spike** \u2014 understand what users are experiencing\\n\\n### Heatmaps\\n\\n![posthog-heatmaps.png](./images/posthog-heatmaps.png)\\n\\nPostHog\'s heatmaps show aggregated click and scroll data across sessions:\\n\\n- **Click maps** \u2014 which elements get the most clicks (including rage-clicks)\\n- **Scroll depth maps** \u2014 how far down the page users typically scroll\\n\\nIf users never scroll to your CTA, it doesn\'t matter how good the copy is.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Part 4: Practical Setup Tips\\n\\n### Error Handling\\nWrap PostHog calls so analytics failures never break your app:\\n\\n```js\\ntry {\\n  posthog.capture(\'event_name\', { property: value });\\n} catch (e) {\\n  // fail silently \u2014 analytics should never break the UX\\n  console.warn(\'Analytics error:\', e);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Performance\\nPostHog\'s SDK is asynchronous and non-blocking. Load it with the `async` attribute or via a deferred script to avoid impacting page load time.\\n\\n### Privacy Best Practices\\n- Don\'t capture raw form values \u2014 PostHog masks inputs by default, keep it that way\\n- Don\'t store passwords, payment info, or other sensitive PII in event properties\\n- Use role/tier rather than email for segmentation where possible\\n- Check your privacy policy covers analytics data collection\\n\\n### Sampling for High-Traffic Sites\\nIf you have very high traffic, use PostHog\'s sampling configuration to reduce event volume and cost while maintaining statistical accuracy.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Key Metrics at a Glance\\n\\n| Category | Metric | Why it matters |\\n|---|---|---|\\n| **Acquisition** | Unique visitors, traffic sources | Where growth comes from |\\n| **Engagement** | Session duration, pages/session | How valuable the experience is |\\n| **Retention** | Return visitor rate, cohort retention | Whether users come back |\\n| **Conversion** | Funnel completion rates | Whether users achieve their goals |\\n| **Performance** | Core Web Vitals | Speed and stability |\\n| **Feature Health** | Feature adoption rates | What you\'ve built is being used |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Lessons Learned\\n\\nWe\'ve implemented PostHog across multiple products \u2014 from SaaS platforms to content-driven web properties \u2014 and the results have been consistently eye-opening. With **multi-domain tracking** configured, we gained a unified view of how users move between marketing sites, product apps, and support portals within the same session. This cross-domain visibility revealed user journeys we simply couldn\'t see before: users who read a blog post, visited the pricing page on a subdomain, and converted to a trial \u2014 all stitched together as a single journey.\\n\\nSome of the measurable benefits we\'ve seen in practice:\\n\\n- **Reduced funnel drop-off by ~30%** after using session recordings to identify and fix a confusing UI step\\n- **Identified that 60%+ of users accessed certain features via mobile**, which directly informed our responsive design backlog\\n- **Correlated slow LCP scores with higher bounce rates** on specific landing pages, leading to targeted performance improvements\\n- **Discovered that organic search drove the highest-quality signups** (lowest churn), shifting our content investment accordingly\\n- **Unified cross-domain user journeys** gave us accurate attribution that was previously split across separate analytics accounts\\n\\n### Optimal Implementation Tips\\n\\n1. **Start with clear goals** \u2014 Define what \\"success\\" looks like before instrumenting anything. Instrument with purpose, not just to have data.\\n2. **Track consistently** \u2014 Use a naming convention from day one (e.g. `noun_verb` like `feature_accessed`, `form_submitted`). Retrofitting event names across a codebase is painful.\\n3. **Add context to every event** \u2014 Properties like `user_role`, `plan`, `feature_name` unlock powerful segmentation. A bare event with no properties tells you very little.\\n4. **Build funnels for every key workflow** \u2014 You can\'t improve what you can\'t measure. Start with your most critical user journey.\\n5. **Set up cross-domain tracking early** \u2014 If your product spans multiple domains or subdomains, configure PostHog\'s cross-domain identity from the start. Adding it later means losing historical continuity.\\n6. **Combine product + web analytics** \u2014 Traffic source data and feature usage data together tell a much richer story than either alone.\\n7. **Act on the data** \u2014 Insights are only valuable if they drive decisions. Schedule a regular analytics review with your team.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\n1. **Sign up** at [posthog.com](https://posthog.com) \u2014 generous free tier available (1M events/month)\\n2. **Install the SDK** for your stack (JS snippet, React, Node, Python, Go, and more)\\n3. **Enable Web Analytics** in project settings \u2014 instant traffic dashboard, no extra code needed\\n4. **Define your top 5 events** to track in the first sprint\\n5. **Build one funnel** for your most important user workflow\\n6. **Set up one dashboard** with the metrics your team cares about most\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nPostHog brings together product analytics, web analytics, session recordings, and feature flags in one open-source platform. Whether you want to understand where your web traffic comes from, watch users navigate your product, or measure funnel conversion rates \u2014 it\'s all in one place. The insights you\'ll gain will help you build a better product\\n\\nStart small, instrument one workflow, and let the data guide your next product decision."},{"id":"load-testing","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/load-testing","source":"@site/blog/2023-03-03-load-testing.md","title":"Load & Performance Testing","description":"perofrmance testing your application services","date":"2023-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"performance","permalink":"/blog/tags/performance"},{"inline":true,"label":"api","permalink":"/blog/tags/api"},{"inline":true,"label":"development","permalink":"/blog/tags/development"}],"readingTime":4.21,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Pavan Kumar","title":"tech-talks Core Team","url":"https://github.com/mrpavan","imageURL":"https://github.com/mrpavan.png","key":"pavan","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"load-testing","title":"Load & Performance Testing","authors":["pavan"],"description":"perofrmance testing your application services","tags":["performance","api","development"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Unlocking Product Insights with PostHog: A Practical Guide to Product and Web Analytics","permalink":"/blog/posthog-product-analytics"},"nextItem":{"title":"Playground - Live Coding","permalink":"/blog/live-coding-demo"}},"content":"![load-testing.png](./images/load-testing.png)\\n\\nPerformance & Load Testing your web services is crucial with APIs becoming more prevalent in usage and required through testing for handling adhoc and busrt loads thoughout the product lifecycle.

Install k6\\n- for mac os with homebrew package manager \\n    ```\\n    brew install k6\\n    ```\\n\\n- for linux or debian follow these steps\\n    ```\\n    sudo gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/k6-archive-keyring.gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys C5AD17C747E3415A3642D57D77C6C491D6AC1D69\\n    echo \\"deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/k6-archive-keyring.gpg] https://dl.k6.io/deb stable main\\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/k6.list\\n    sudo apt-get update\\n    sudo apt-get install k6\\n    ```\\n - refer k6 documentation for additional options [k6](https://k6.io/docs/get-started/installation/)\\n\\n 2. Get started with test scripts\\n To perform testing on your web application & apis; create new script file for example ***script.js*** and use below sample code  \\n\\n\\n ```\\n    import http from \'k6/http\';\\n    import { sleep } from \'k6\';\\n\\n    export default function () {\\n    http.get(\'https://test.k6.io\');\\n    sleep(1);\\n    }\\n\\n ```\\n\\n **If you are feeling to do more use below script**\\n\\n ```\\nimport {check} from \'k6\';\\nimport http from \'k6/http\';\\n\\nconst URL = \'https://dummyjson.com/products/1\'\\n// const SEARCH_URL = \'https://dummyjson.com/products/search?q=phone\'\\n\\n\\nvar params = {\\n    Headers: {\\n        \'Content-Type\': \'application/json\',\\n        // \'Authorization\':\'Bearer your key or bearer tokens for the api endpoint\'\\n    },\\n};\\n\\n// Simple Get request for 5 concuerrent in 3 s\\n\\nexport let options = {\\n    vus: 5,\\n    duration: \'30s\'\\n}\\n\\n\\nexport default function () {\\n    let res = http.get(URL, params);\\n    // console.log(res)\\n    check(res, {\\n        \'is status 200\': (r) => r.status ===200\\n    });\\n}\\n\\n ```\\n\\n3. Run the tests - use the command ``` k6 run script.js``` where script.js is the file name in step 2 above. script file can be named anything, as a best practice name it base don on waht script is expected to do\\n\\n4. By default it uses 1 virtual user, for running multiple users or simultaneous users use ``` k6 run --vus 5 --duration 30s script.js``` this refers to 5 virtual users for the duration of 30 seconds. Add or change numbers based on what you are trying to acheive. Also can be added to the script under options object. Additional options are available, refer to [K6 documentation](https://k6.io/docs/get-started/running-k6/)\\n\\n4.

Introduction**\\nManaging customer data effectively is crucial for any business that wants to stay competitive in today\'s digital landscape. With the abundance of data available, it can be difficult to make sense of it all, but having a clear understanding of your customers can help you make better decisions, improve customer engagement, and ultimately drive more revenue.\\n\\n**Overview CDP and DMP**\\nCustomer Data Platform (CDP) and a Data Management Platform (DMP) are both systems that help organizations manage and analyze customer data. However, they have different focuses and use cases. A CDP is primarily focused on creating a single customer view, while a DMP is focused on segmentation and targeting.\\n\\n### II. What is a Customer Data Platform (CDP)?\\n\\nA Customer Data Platform (CDP) is a system that centralizes, cleans, and manages customer data from various sources, such as website interactions, marketing campaigns, and CRM systems. It aims to provide a single source of truth for customer data, allowing organizations to better understand and engage with their customers\\n\\n- Key functionality - CDP centralizes, cleans, and manages customer data\\n\\n  CDPs collect data from various sources, such as website interactions, marketing campaigns, and CRM systems, and then centralize it in a single location. This allows organizations to have a comprehensive view of their customers. The data is also cleaned and standardized to ensure consistency and accuracy. CDPs can also merge duplicate data to create a single customer profile.\\n\\n- Usecase : CDP can be used to improve customer engagement and understanding\\n\\n  CDPs can be used to personalize marketing campaigns and website experiences for individual customers. By providing a complete view of customer data, CDPs can help organizations identify and target specific segments of customers, such as high-value customers or those at risk of churn. CDPs can also be used to track customer interactions and preferences over time, allowing organizations to build more meaningful relationships with their customers.\\n\\n### III. What is a Data Management Platform (DMP)?\\n\\nA Data Management Platform (DMP) is a system that collects, organizes, and segments data from various sources, such as website interactions, marketing campaigns, and CRM systems. It aims to provide actionable insights and targeted marketing opportunities through the creation of audience segments.\\n\\n- Key functionality - DMP collects, organizes, and segments data\\n\\n  DMPs collect data from a variety of sources and organize it into audience segments. These segments can be based on demographics, behavior, interests, or other characteristics. The data is then used to create targeted marketing campaigns, identify high-value audiences, and optimize ad spend.\\n\\n-  Usecase : DMP can be used to improve targeting and audience insights\\n\\n  DMPs can be used to create targeted marketing campaigns that reach specific segments of customers. By identifying high-value audiences, organizations can optimize their ad spend and reach the most valuable customers. DMPs can also be used to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences, allowing organizations to make data-driven decisions about how to engage with their customers.\\n\\n  IV. Comparison of CDP and DMP\\n\\n  Both CDP and DMPs are used to manage and analyze customer data, but they have different focuses. CDPs are primarily focused on creating a single customer view, while DMPs are focused on segmentation and targeting. Both systems collect and organize data from various sources, but CDPs are designed to provide a comprehensive view of the customer, while DMPs are designed to provide actionable insights and targeted marketing opportunities.\\n\\n  While CDPs and DMPs have different focuses, they can complement each other and be used together to create a more comprehensive customer data strategy. By using a CDP to create a single customer view, organizations can gain a better understanding of their customers and then use that information to create targeted segments with a DMP. This allows organizations to personalize their marketing efforts, optimize ad spend, and build more meaningful relationships with their customers.\\n\\n### V. List of Key players or Platforms\\n\\nThere are many different platforms available in the Customer Data Platform (CDP) and Data Management Platform (DMP) space, some popular ones include:\\n\\n1.

Look no further than sprint planning! In this article, we\'ll dive into the world of Agile methodology and explore the importance of sprint activities in delivering value to customers in a timely manner.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n\\n**What is a Sprint?** \\nA sprint is a time-boxed period in Agile software development, typically lasting between one and four weeks(though 2 weeks is quite common across software development teams), during which a defined set of work is completed. The goal of a sprint is to deliver a potentially releasable product increment.\\n\\nEffective sprint planning, execution, and review are essential for project success. By breaking down work into smaller, manageable chunks, sprints allow teams to quickly adapt to changing requirements and deliver value to customers in a timely manner.\\n\\n**Importance of Sprint in Agile Methodology**\\nSprints are a key component of Agile methodology, which emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and rapid feedback. By breaking down work into smaller, manageable chunks, sprints allow teams to quickly adapt to changing requirements and deliver value to customers in a timely manner.\\n\\n**Purpose of Sprint Activities**\\nThe purpose of sprint activities is to plan, execute, and review the work that will be completed during the sprint in order to deliver a potentially releasable product increment. These activities include sprint planning, daily scrum meetings, sprint review, and sprint retrospective.\\n\\n**Key Roles and Responsibilities**\\n- **The Scrum Master** is responsible for facilitating the meeting, ensuring that it stays on track, and addressing any issues that arise. \\n- **The Product Owner** is responsible for presenting the backlog and prioritizing tasks. \\n- **The development team** is responsible for estimating the time and effort required to complete the tasks and identifying any dependencies or risks.\\n\\n### Sprint Planning\\n\\nSprint planning is a collaborative effort between the development team, Scrum Master, and Product Owner. Before the sprint planning meeting, the team should set clear goals for the sprint and create a backlog of tasks to be completed.\\n\\n- Setting Goals: The team should identify the goals for the sprint, including what features or functionality they want to deliver, and what improvements they want to make to the product.\\n\\n- Creating a Backlog: The Product Owner is responsible for creating and prioritizing a backlog of tasks that need to be completed during the sprint. The backlog should be reviewed and refined before the sprint planning meeting.\\n\\n- The Sprint Planning Meeting: During the sprint planning meeting, the development team, Scrum Master, and Product Owner will review the goals and backlog, and plan how to achieve them during the sprint.\\n\\nEstimating and Prioritizing Tasks: During the sprint planning meeting, the development team will estimate the time and effort required to complete each task in the backlog. The team will then prioritize the tasks based on the goals for the sprint and the priorities set by the Product Owner.\\n\\n### Sprint Execution\\n-  Daily Scrum Meetings: Daily scrum meetings are short, 15-minute meetings that are held every day during the sprint. The purpose of these meetings is to give the development team an opportunity to plan their work for the day, and to identify any issues that need to be addressed.\\n\\n- The daily scrum meeting follows a simple structure, with each team member answering three questions: What did I do yesterday? What will I do today? Are there any blockers or issues?\\n\\n- Benefits for Team and Project: Daily scrum meetings help to ensure that the development team is on track to meet the sprint goals, and they provide an opportunity for the team to quickly address any issues or blockers that may arise.\\n\\n- Sprint Review: The sprint review is a meeting held at the end of each sprint to review the work that has been completed and to get feedback from stakeholders. The agenda for the sprint review should include a demonstration of the new features or functionality, a review of the sprint goals, and a discussion of any issues or risks that need to be addressed. The sprint review is an opportunity for stakeholders, such as the Product Owner, customers, and other members of the organization, to provide feedback and input on the work that has been completed. This feedback can be used to adjust the backlog and priorities for the next sprint.\\n\\n- Sprint Retrospective: The sprint retrospective is a meeting held at the end of each sprint to review the sprint process and identify areas for improvement. The outcomes of the sprint retrospective should include actionable items that can be implemented in the next sprint to improve the overall process. During the sprint retrospective, the development team, Scrum Master, and Product Owner should review the sprint process, including the sprint planning, daily scrum meetings, sprint review, and any other activities that were conducted. They should identify any challenges that arose and look for ways to improve the process in the next sprint.\\n\\n### Typical daily tasks in a 2 weeks sprint plan\\n\\nThe daily tasks for a 10-day sprint will depend on the specific goals and tasks that have been defined during the sprint planning meeting. However, here is a general outline of daily tasks that may be completed during a 10-day sprint:\\n\\n**Day 1:**\\n\\n1. Review sprint goals and backlog\\n2. Identify and prioritize tasks for the day\\n3. Begin work on high-priority tasks\\n\\n**Day 2-9:**\\n\\n1. Attend daily scrum meeting to review progress and plan for the day\\n2. Continue work on high-priority tasks\\n3. Address any issues or blockers that arise\\n4. Participate in team collaboration and knowledge-sharing\\n5. Continuously update task status on the tracking tool\\n\\n**Day 10** (Last Day of the Sprint)\\n\\n1. Wrap up any remaining tasks\\n2. Prepare for the sprint review and retrospective meetings\\n3. Review and update the backlog for the next sprint\\n4. Submit completed work for review\\n\\nIt is also important to note that the daily scrum meeting is an important part of the sprint process, and should be held every day, regardless of the day in the sprint. This daily meeting helps the team to stay on track, identify any issues or blockers, and ensure that the sprint goals are being met.\\n\\n\\n### Recap of key takeaways\\nSprints are a key component of Agile methodology, which allows teams to deliver value to customers in a timely manner. Sprint activities include sprint planning, daily scrum meetings, sprint review, and sprint retrospective. These activities help teams to plan, execute, and review the work that will be completed during the sprint in order to deliver a potentially releasable product increment.\\n\\nSprint activities can be implemented in any type of project, not just software development. By following the steps outlined in this article, one can start to implement sprints in their own projects and experience the benefits of Agile methodology.\\n\\n### Additional Resources \\nTo learn more about Agile methodology and sprints, refer to resources such as the Scrum Guide, \\"Agile Estimating and Planning\\" by Mike Cohn, and \\"Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time\\" by Jeff Sutherland.\\n\\nThere are many tools available to assist with sprint planning and execution, such as [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/), [Trello](https://trello.com/), [Asana](https://asana.com/), and [monday.com](https://www.momday.com). These tools can help teams to manage their backlog, track progress, and collaborate more effectively."},{"id":"json-web-tokens","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/json-web-tokens","source":"@site/blog/2022-05-27-json-web-tokens.md","title":"JWT","description":"You might have heard about JWT if you are in field of developing applications or not from other domains.

It is typically used to securely transmit information between a server and a client, such as an API and a single-page application. JWTs are a useful tool for securely transmitting information between parties, and are commonly used in modern web applications for authentication and authorization\\n\\nA JWT consists of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA. The payload contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. There are three types of claims: registered, public, and private claims. Registered claims are a set of predefined claims that are not mandatory but recommended, to provide a set of useful, interoperable claims. Some of the registered claims are: iss (issuer), exp (expiration time), sub (subject), aud (audience), and others. Public claims are claims that are defined in the IANA JSON Web Token Registry or defined in other specifications, but are not registered. Private claims are claims that are used to share information between parties that agree on using them and are neither registered or public claims...\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nThe signature is used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and to ensure that the message wasn\'t changed along the way. The signature is created by taking the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, and the algorithm specified in the header, and signing that. For example, if you want to use the HMAC SHA256 algorithm, the signature will be created in the following way:\\n\\nHMACSHA256(\\nbase64UrlEncode(header) + \\".\\" +\\nbase64UrlEncode(payload),\\nsecret)\\n\\nTo verify the signature, the recipient of the JWT needs to compute the signature and compare it to the one provided in the JWT. If they match, the JWT is considered to be valid.\\n\\nJWTs are commonly used to authenticate users. When a user logs in to a system, the server generates a JWT that contains the user\'s information, such as the user\'s name, email, and other details, and signs it with a secret. The JWT is then sent back to the client, where it is stored in a cookie or local storage. When the client makes a request to the server, it includes the JWT in the request header. The server verifies the signature and, if it is valid, grants the client access to the requested resource.\\n\\nJWTs have a number of benefits over traditional authentication methods, such as cookies and sessions. They are stateless, meaning that the server does not need to store any information about the client in order to verify the JWT. This makes them scalable and easy to implement. They are also secure, as they are signed and can\'t be modified without the signature being invalidated.\\n\\n**Example**\\neyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c\\n\\nThis JWT has three parts, separated by dots (.). The first part is the header, which consists of the type of the token (JWT) and the signing algorithm being used (HS256). The second part is the payload, which contains the claims. In this case, the claims are the subject (sub), which is the user\'s ID, and the name (name) of the user. The third part is the signature, which is used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and to ensure that the message wasn\'t changed along the way.\\n\\nHere is the same JWT, with the parts decoded:\\n\\nHeader:\\n```json\\n{\\n\\"alg\\": \\"HS256\\",\\n\\"typ\\": \\"JWT\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nPayload:\\n```json\\n{\\n\\"sub\\": \\"1234567890\\",\\n\\"name\\": \\"John Doe\\",\\n\\"iat\\": 1516239022\\n}\\n```\\n\\nTo create this JWT, you would first need to create the header and payload as JSON objects, and then encode them using base64Url encoding. Then, you would create the signature by signing the encoded header and payload with a secret using the HMAC SHA256 algorithm.\\n\\nTo verify the signature of this JWT, you would need to decode the header and payload and then recompute the signature using the same algorithm and secret. If the signature you compute matches the one provided in the JWT, the JWT is considered to be valid.\\n\\n**nodejs sample**\\n\\nTo use JWTs in a Node.js application, you can use the jsonwebtoken library. This library provides functions for creating and verifying JWTs.\\n\\nHere is an example of how you can use the jsonwebtoken library to create a JWT:\\n\\n```js\\nconst jwt = require(\'jsonwebtoken\');\\n\\nconst payload = {\\n  sub: \'1234567890\',\\n  name: \'John Doe\'\\n};\\n\\nconst secret = \'my-secret\';\\n\\nconst token = jwt.sign(payload, secret);\\n\\n```\\n\\nThe sign() function takes the payload and the secret as arguments, and returns the JWT. The payload can be any JSON object, and the secret is a string that is used to sign the JWT.\\n\\nHere is an example of how you can use the jsonwebtoken library to verify a JWT:\\n\\n```js\\nconst jwt = require(\'jsonwebtoken\');\\n\\nconst token = \'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c\';\\nconst secret = \'my-secret\';\\n\\ntry {\\n  const payload = jwt.verify(token, secret);\\n  console.log(payload);\\n} catch (error) {\\n  console.error(error);\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\nThe verify() function takes the JWT and the secret as arguments, and returns the payload if the signature is valid. If the signature is invalid, it throws an error.\\n\\nYou can also pass additional options to the sign() and verify() functions, such as the expiration time of the JWT or the audience for which the JWT is intended."},{"id":"digital-marketing","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/digital-marketing","source":"@site/blog/2022-05-05-digital-marketing.md","title":"From Social Media to SEO: Navigating the World of Digital Marketing","description":"Digital marketing refers to the use of digital channels and technologies to promote products or services.
